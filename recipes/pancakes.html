            <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
            <li>White Sugar</li>
            <li>Leaveners</li>

            <li>Mix Dry Ingredients</li>
            <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. </p>
            <li>Mix Wet Ingredients</li>
            <p>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl.
                Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.
            </p>
            <li>Make The Pancakes</li>
            <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or
                fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle
                and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and
                cook until both sides are brown.</p>

            <p>There's nothing like plain buttermilk pancakes topped with syrup, you could
                also top your buttermilk pancakes with jam or honey for a sweet twist on a classic. </p>
